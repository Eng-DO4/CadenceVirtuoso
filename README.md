# CadenceVirtuoso
I have worked with a team to design 4-bit ALU using CMOS, Pass Transistor Logic, umc90n technology
I have paticipated in :
1. Designing from scratch
  - Inverter
  - 2 input XOR Gate
  - 2 input XNOR Gate
  - MUX 2x1
  - MUX 8x1
2. Doing testbench for this gates to make sure they works properly
