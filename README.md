# CadenceVirtuoso
I have worked with a team to design 4-bit ALU using (project for 6th semester course) CMOS, Pass Transistor Logic, umc130n technology

I have paticipated in :
<ol>
  <li>
    Designing from scratch (schematic)
    <ul>
      <li>Inverter</li>
      <li>2 input XOR Gate</li>
      <li>2 input XNOR Gate</li>
      <li>MUX 2x1</li>
      <li>MUX 8x1</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Doing testbench for this gates to make sure they works properly</li>
</ol>
